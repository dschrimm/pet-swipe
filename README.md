# Schrimmer Product Plan

### Problem Statement
+ Hundreds of thousands of pets are posted online and awaiting adoption. How might we create a service to make it easier for people to find good matches and keep track of pets they are interested in?

### Market Research
#### Petfinder Mobile
+ User complaints: Out of date, “freezes constantly”, color scheme can be difficult to read, breeds cannot be found by typing, only one breed at a time can be selected, limited search fields
+ Differentiation: This app will prioritize accessibility and usability and have extended search functionalities
#### Woof Rescue
+ User complaints: Cannot easily scroll from one pet to another, same pets are shown over and over, pet images automatically go through slideshow feature at predetermined rate, must pay for “favorites” capabilities or to add certain search filters, not current - dogs are not removed after adoption
+ Differentiation: This app will allow for easy navigation from one pet to another, update frequently, and allow for saving of favorites

### User personas
+ Expected user: Adults 20-60+ looking for a pet or who enjoy looking at photos of animals.
