                        "__cdata": "A tragic fire destroys the family home.  An unexpected job loss destines a family to move from a house to an apartment.  A health issue forces major life changes.  In each of these scenarios, and countless others, a beloved family dog loses the only home that it has known.\n\nWashington German Shepherd Rescue can provide a safe and healing environment for these dogs by saving them from the stress and isolation of an animal shelter and an uncertain future.  But this is true only if there are enough foster families available to help.\n\nDo you, or someone you know, have the time and extra space in your home and in your heart to foster one of these special dogs?  Have you considered adopting a dog, perhaps a second dog, but do not want to commit to a 12-15 year lifespan? Fostering a German Shepherd could be right for you!\n\nGerman Shepherds long for companionship, enjoy exercise and are eager to learn. Foster homes can provide all of this and more by preparing the dog for his or her special new family. A soft bed to rest on; a gentle hand to provide comfort; a safe haven during an otherwise stressful period of their life. Fostering a displaced dog is both challenging and rewarding. Special people helping special dogs find their forever home.\n\nPlease email us directly at washingtonshepherds@yahoo.com for more information about this vital service of our rescue program.  Your help can make a tremendous difference in the lives of many dogs.\n\nRescue work is a great way to meet new people!  And our volunteers are invited to WGSR private events.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook?

                        "__cdata": "Barend is a young and playful dog!  He knows some basic obedience and loves to play fetch with balls and Frisbee.\n\nBarend is respectful of the senior Pit Bull he is being fostered with, but would most likely love another large breed dog to play with. He is calm in the house, but loves to be outside running around.  Barend has no food or toy aggression toward any of the dogs in his foster home and will share his toys when the senior pit bull decides he wants to play.\n\nWe are currently unsure how Barend will do with a dominant dog.  He may or may not back down from an alpha who tries to dominate him.\n\nBarend chases rabbits, birds and feral cats that come on to the property.  Since his previous owner and current foster home do not have cats, we cannot place him in a home with them.\n\nBarend will benefit from someone experienced with guardian breeds as he moves into adulthood.  As Barend needs all alpha experienced people in his household, he will not go into a home with children.\n\nBarend is left loose in the house in a spare room and chooses to curl up in a big chair while his foster mom is at work.  He will need a home with a fully fenced yard.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Barend, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained within this biography is based on observations from the current foster home.  In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nPlease fill out an application to meet me at http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook?

                        "__cdata": "Emme is a beautiful six-year-old female German Shepherd Dog who has just arrived into rescue!\n\nEmme is incredibly affectionate and loving.  She loves to be cuddled and pet.\n\nEmme has excellent house manners and is very quiet.  She is crate-trained, but her house manners are so perfect that she is loose in the house when her foster dad leaves.  Emme sits on her dog bed and looks out the window.\n\nEmme has excellent leash manners, too, and she rides perfectly in the car, loose or crated.  She sits down and enjoys the ride.\n\nEmme was just diagnosed with Pannus, which is very common with German Shepherds.  She will simply need her eye drops twice a day with two different eye drops.\n\nEmme is fostered with a foster puppy, two adult German Shepherds and a cat.  However, she would really love to be an only pet in the household.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Emme, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained within this biography is based on observations from the current foster home.  In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nThe first step in the adoption process is to visit our website and submit an application: http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nA volunteer will review your application, shortly.\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook? Our Facebook account is updated daily with information about our rescue dogs and volunteer opportunities!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WashingtonGermanShepherdRescue"

                        "__cdata": "Karah is a young, sable, female, German Shepherd Dog and new to rescue!\n\nKarah is very agile, fun and social.  She is well suited for jogging, running or hiking.  Karah’s ideal home is with someone who is active and has the time for continued obedience classes.  She is looking for the dedicated adopter who has the time to engage with her.\n\nDue to her young age, Karah is best suited to a home with a fenced yard.  She is currently too young for condo living.  The first night Karah arrived into rescue, off she went to the mall for late night shopping!  She did excellent in the store with all of the other people shopping and was also with her new foster brother (in the photo) and foster sister, Ivy, the puppy (also available for adoption).\n\nKarah loves to play with other dogs.  She wrestles and chases.  Karah also loves toys and her ball.  She is housebroken and crate-trained.  Karah has not been tested yet with cats.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Karah, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained within this biography is based on observations from the current foster home.  In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nThe first step in the adoption process is to visit our website and submit an application: http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nA volunteer will review your application, shortly.\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook? Our Facebook account is updated daily with information about our rescue dogs and volunteer opportunities!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WashingtonGermanShepherdRescue"

We think she is a Staffordshire terrier/ Bull terrier  mix---she weighs in at about 50 pounds and has  the most gorgeous short shiny brindle coat--- Tess loves people and is good with other dogs if they are friendly and are introduced correctly---  She  is not a dog that loves big groups of dogs at a dog park—so we are looking for a great family for Tess that has  a nice yard to play in and that would take her for some leash walks or even a run if you would like.  She loves to ride in the car and is a great riding buddy--- She also LOVES to sit in the back of a truck as you can see---we do not allow her to ride back there—but she has a great time just sitting in there while the truck is parked !!!   Maybe in her past life she was allowed to ride in the back---but only inside the vehicles now !!\n \nTess has a lot of love to give and is waiting patiently for her forever family--- She is a bully breed—so we want to make sure that anyone applying not live in an area where there are breed restrictions or problems with insurance--- Since she is larger we would not adopt her to a home with small children—older gentle kids that knew how to be gentle and kind would be fine for Tessa.  Please contact Lee Selman at leeselman@comcast.net for more information."

                        "__cdata": "Rommel has just arrived into rescue!  Rommel lost his home after the owner passed away.\n\nRommel is a very sweet and handsome boy.  He is 5 years old—the perfect age for a shepherd!  Rommel lives with other dogs and enjoys their company.  He is crate-trained and rides perfectly in the car in the crate, too.\n\nRommel absolutely adores playing in the water.  He was visiting a friend's home and made a straight line to the pond!  Rommel also loves going for walks.  He has wonderful energy for walks or hiking.\n\nRommel is super sweet and very easy going.  After his foster home picked him up from the grooming place, he pranced right outside.  Two groups of people in front of the business in Seattle came right up to pet him and say, “Hello.”\n\nYou could not ask for a nicer dog!\n\nIf you would like to adopt Rommel, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained within this biography is based on observations from the current foster home.  In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nPlease fill out an application to meet me at http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nFENCED YARD REQUIRED FOR ANY OF OUR DOGS!!\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook? Our Facebook account is updated daily with information about our rescue dogs and volunteer opportunities!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WashingtonGermanShepherdRescue"

                        "__cdata": "Dottie is a gorgeous black and tan hound/ bassett mix girl---she does not have the short short legs like a bassett but definitely her legs are on the shorter side—Her coat is a beautiful jet black and very shiny with the brown accents.  Her date of birth is approximately June 2015—she was adopted as a puppy and then when the family was going to have a baby they turned her into the shelter—no fault of her own—we see this happen a lot sadly—She weighs in at about 50 pounds and is great with other dogs--- she is fostered with Belle , also on our site and they play and have a great time--  She has  nice manners and sleeps through the night in her crate---she gets along with the two older larger dogs in her foster home—but she is too interested in cats and chickens  - so we are looking for a non cat and chicken forever home---This girl would be a great family dog and loves to be part of the activities of her family---Hiking, camping, jogging—she is up for all of it !!!

She has had both her elbows and hips X-rayed and is OFA certified as showing no evidence of dysplasia.\n\nIlsa’s previous home absolutely adored and loved her, but felt she needed a home without small dogs and cats.\n\nIlsa has met another male GSD in our rescue (see video) and they had a great time playing.  Therefore, a home without other pets or a home with a male, large breed, dog will work for her.\n\nIlsa is incredibly people social and loves going in the car.  She is crate-trained and has impeccable house manners.  Ilsa will need a house with a fenced yard for her new home.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Ilsa, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained within this biography is based on observations from the current foster home.  In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nThe first step in the adoption process is to visit our website and submit an application: http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nA volunteer will review your application, shortly.\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook? Our Facebook account is updated daily with information about our rescue dogs and volunteer opportunities!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WashingtonGermanShepherdRescue"

We estimate that SANDY will be a larger dog---60 pounds at least-----SANDY has 10 siblings so she is very social with other dogs—in addition there are some large dogs at her foster home and she is  ok with them as well----  SANDY would do well with another dog or would also love a family that would take her along on their adventures—Please make sure you have the time to train a puppy and room for the full size version of SANDY!!!-she would have so much fun taking walks and going for camping or hiking adventures—whatever her family wanted to do !!!   Please contact Lee Selman at leeselman@comcast.net for more information."

We estimate that Blondie will be a larger dog---60 pounds at least----  our best guess on the mix would be yellow lab/ shepherd---Blondie has 10 siblings so she is very social with other dogs—in addition there are some large dogs at her foster home and she is  ok with them as well---- Blondie would do well with another dog or would also love a family that would take her along on their adventures---she would have so much taking walks and going for camping or hiking adventures—whatever her family wanted to do !!!"

We will know more soon.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Zeus, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained within this biography is based on observations from the current foster home.  In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nThe first step in the adoption process is to visit our website and submit an application: http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nA volunteer will review your application, shortly.\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook?

In no way can we predict future behavior and or temperament as individual household dynamics vary greatly, and are impacted by the experience and leadership of those within the home.\n\nThe first step in the adoption process is to visit our website and submit an application: http://www.washingtongsd.org/application.html\n\nA volunteer will review your application, shortly.\n\nThe adoption process includes completion of an adoption application, a vet check, a home visit and a lifetime adoption contract.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come first serve basis. WA German Shepherd Rescue is the companion animal's advocate and will select the most suitably matched home for the dog's general needs and the unique needs of each individual dog in our care.  We reserve the right to refuse service and adoption without explanation.\n\nAre you following us on Facebook? Our Facebook account is updated daily with information about our rescue dogs and volunteer opportunities!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WashingtonGermanShepherdRescue"

She has done so well as she has gotten both physically and emotionally  healthy and learned about being social and part of a family—We are looking for a dog savvy family that will continue to help her learn about the good life – Dog ownership experience is a plus –she is very sweet but probably no small children or toddlers---she loves the company of other sweet and social dogs—so we would like her to have another great pup in her home--- This girl has a lot of love to give and we want to make sure she will be a spoiled and pampered princess in his new forever home---  Contact Lee Selman at leeselman@comcast.net for more information."
